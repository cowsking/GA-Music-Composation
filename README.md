# GA Music Composation
## Project Description

The automatic composition has a long history. Some researchers have found fixed regulations in automatic composition. However, few of them focus on some specific musical genre. This project aims to design a music composition algorithm in melodies of canon and fugue, which are two types of polyphonic music form. It provides a visual possibility for enhancing listeners a deeper understanding of these two music form. The genetic algorithm is mainly used in the generating process, and the fractal geometry will be introduced in the display phase.
